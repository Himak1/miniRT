# miniRT
My implementation for the miniRT project from the 42 Network Curriculum. A very minimal raytracer for macOS. 
It was handed in and graded on 29-11-2021. No changes have been made to the files since. 
The project was written by following the methods and theory described The Raytracer Challenge from James Buck.



## Project Notes
 - The lack of multi-threading was a limitation imposed by the assignment's subject.
 - Functions were not allowed to be longer than 25 lines.
 - The mlx folder in the repository is the libmlx library created by the 42 Network. I was given permission to use it for this project.

## Project in hindsight
When I finished this project I only had 1 year of programming experience. It was also the biggest project I had worked on a that point.
Looking back there are obviously many things I would have approached differently in terms of file and code structure and testing during development.
These are things I might try to address in a seperate branch if my schedule permits it.
